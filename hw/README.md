### Nautilus Controller Hardware

In this folder you can find the schematic in pdf format to reproduce in your desired EDA software tool. Gerber files are provided too in order to guide you how to layout the components. Since we are in a middle of a global semiconductors shortage BOM is not provided since mot probably some of the components used will not be available ;(
